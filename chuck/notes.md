# Step 1

- What if I don't have an OOP language?
- types.qx could be more promently mentioned...
- A table with all types and suggested object names would be hugely
  useful
- Same for a list of all errors and their messages
- Mention return types and argument types consistently
- More on int/float and their grammar (int is mentioned implicitly in
  the ASCII art, nothing on signs or bases or their lack of)
- Note that a string must be parsed for the `print_readably` thing to
  work and mention how one could do that (like, by using a `read` or
  `eval`-like thing or alternatively, chopping off the surrounding
  quotes and doing the inverse transformation of the printing)
- How is an atom printed?
